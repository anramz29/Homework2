Although I may not have added as much creativity as some people, I believe that my code is follows ideas of encapsulating variables effectively. One of my favorite creative parts is that I added a label for a "deal of the day", and integrated this detail into my Price Display Panel Class well. Furthermore, I tried to minimize hardcoding aspects of the GUI; for example, instead of creating a new JCheckBox for every topping, I iterated over a list of toppings. Additionally, I made use of lambda functions for my checkbox's addItemListener. Instead of allowing the addition of more than three toppings, then clicking calculate, and subsequently an error popping up. I use the item listener to display a max toppings message before you even have to press calculate. All in all, I think this program encapsulates my strong traditional Java skills with the new concept of using a GUI.
